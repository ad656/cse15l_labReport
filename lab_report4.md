# Snippet 1
**Test case and output for Snippet 1 for my respository.** 
![test written for my repository](my1.png)
I think that there could be a small change implemented to make this code work since checking for backticks could be similiar to the code checking for extra parantheses and brackets. This would probably take the form of adding if statements checking for backticks.

Similiarly, I think that a small change could be made in order to make the code work in outputting the right links. Following the algorithm they were originally using, I would probably add a variable that is equal to the index of the backticks and check them every loop. 

# Snippet 2

For this Snippet, I don't think that a small change could be implemented to help my code reach the correct output due to the sheer amount of specific things that we would have to check for. I would fix the code in a similiar way to Snippet 1, but it would take a lot more lines since more if statements and checks would be needed.

This code could probably be fixed within 10 lines in order to ouptut the correct links for Snippet 2. By making use of the variables they have created in their method, we could probably make the code work by adding a lot of extra checks to the if statements already written instead of adding new ones. 

# Snippet 3
**Test case and output for Snippet 3 for my repository**

I could probably fix the code in 10 lines or less to result in a correct ouput. Since the error with this Snippet lies in the fact that there are so many extra lines and spaces in between the brackets and paratheses that the code is checking for, it could be easily fixed by making the algorithm keep checking for brackets/parantheses even when not on the same line.

I don't think that a small change would be enough to fix this code to allow for the correct output. When Snippet 3 runs, it prints the last line even though it is not even in brackets or parentheses, which shows that part of the loop/ if statements are pretty out of place, which would probably require more than 10 lines to fix.
